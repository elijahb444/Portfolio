## Portfolio

# Description

The reasons for this project are twofold: 
Firstly, to further my understanding of both HTML and CSS by applying it and building a true website from scratch. This process was not without its ordeals, but I suppose that was the point. 
Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, this project serves as a portfolio for any future hiring teams/interested parties. Pretty haughty of me, I know. 

The portfolio, while live, is still far from complete. As I learn and build and grow, so too will the portfolio. But, feel free to take a look now.
